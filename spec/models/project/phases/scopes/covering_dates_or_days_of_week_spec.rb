  # Constructs the keyword arguments for the `#covering_dates_or_days_of_week` method.
  # It's a `{ days_of_week:, dates: }` hash for given days of week built differently
  # depending on the `days_args_strategy` value.
  #
  # `days_args_strategy` can take the following values:
  # - `:days_of_week_only`: returns `{ days_of_week: ..., dates: [] }` so it
  #   only contains days of week
  # - `:dates_only`: returns `{ days_of_week: [], dates: ... }` so it only
  #   contains specific dates for the specified days of weeks over the next 2
  #   weeks
  # - `:mixed`: returns `{ days_of_week: ..., dates: ... }` so it contains a mix of days
  #   of week and specific dates: Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday are days of week, and
  #   Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are dates
