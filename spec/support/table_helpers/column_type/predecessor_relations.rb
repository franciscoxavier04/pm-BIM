module TableHelpers
  module ColumnType
    # Column to add predecessors to work packages like "wp1, wp2 with lag 2, wp3".
    #
    # Supported texts:
    #   - :wp
    #   - :wp with lag :int
    #   - follows :wp
    #   - follows :wp with lag :int
    # They can be combined by separated them with commas: "follows wp1, wp2 with lag 2, wp3".
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   | subject   | predecessors            |
    #   | main      |                         |
    #   | follower  | follows main with lag 2 |
    #   | follower2 | follows follower, main  |
    #
    # Adapted from (now deleted) original implementation
    # in `spec/support/schedule_helpers/chart_builder.rb`.
