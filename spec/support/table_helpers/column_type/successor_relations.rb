    # Column to add successors to work packages like "wp1, wp2 with lag 2, wp3".
    #
    # Supported texts:
    #   - :wp
    #   - :wp with lag :int
    #   - precedes :wp
    #   - precedes :wp with lag :int
    # They can be combined by separated them with commas: "precedes wp1, wp2 with lag 2, wp3".
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   | subject      | successors                   |
    #   | predecessor2 | main, predecessor with lag 2 |
    #   | predecessor  | precedes main                |
    #   | main         |                              |
