# When test is finished, Capybara calls `Capybara.reset!` which in turn calls
# `driver.reset!`. This one is responsible for stopping the browser by
# navigating to about:blank page and waiting for pending requests to complete.
#
# With Cuprite, we observed that some requests could still be triggered from the
# browser after `Capybara.reset!` is called. It can interfere with test
# execution is some unexpected ways: when a request to the API is made, the
# settings are read from the database. If this happens right when the database
# is being rolled back to a previous savepoint (which happens when using
# `before_all` helper), then in postgres dapater code there is a `nil` reference
# instead of a result, and then it errs with "NoMethodError: undefined method
# 'clear' for nil".
#
# You can run tests from `spec/features/work_packages/progress_modal_spec.rb` a
# couple of times to experiment the error. It happens mostly with tests having
# the most nested `before_all` calls.
#
# We tried navigating to about:blank with Cuprite, but some requests were still
# made. So we looked for another fix.
#
# Using a middleware to actively block requests outside of test execution fixed
# the issue.
