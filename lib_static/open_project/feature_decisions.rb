module OpenProject
  ##
  # This module is the container for temporary or permanent feature flags.
  #
  # New feature flags can automatically be added by calling
  #
  #   OpenProject::FeatureDecisions.add :the_name_of_the_flag
  #
  # See config/initializers/feature_decisions.rb.
  #
  # This will set up:
  # * the method `.the_name_of_the_flag_active?` for querying the state
  #   of the flag. By default, it is false.
  # * fetching the overwritten value from
  #   * ENV variable (`OPENPROJECT_FEATURE_THE_NAME_OF_THE_FLAG_ACTIVE = 'true'`)
  #   * configuration.yml file (`the_name_of_the_flag_active: true`)
  #   * from the settings database table (`Setting.feature_the_name_of_the_flag_active = true)
  # * including the flag in the `.active` array in case it is enabled
  # * including the flag in the `.all`
  #
  # The setup should be carried out inside an initializer for the overwriting from ENV or configuration.yml
  # to be picked up.
  #
  # A spec in which such a flag is to be enabled can do so via:
  #
  #   context 'some description', with_flag: { the_name_of_the_flag: true } do
  #     ...
  #   end
  #
  # There is an interface to toggle flags on a running instance at path /admin/settings/experimental.

  module FeatureDecisions
    module_function

    ##
    # Adds a new feature flag to the system, setting up flag-specific methods and settings configurations.
    # By default, the feature flag is inactive in production but active in development. A user can
    # choose to activate it via ENV variable or in the administration.
    # Once a feature is fully developed and tested, it can be set to always be active in production
    # by setting `force_active: true`. Then, the ENV variable and the setting will be ignored.
    # After the release, the feature flag can then be removed from the codebase.
    #
    # === Example:
    # Adding a new feature flag:
    #   OpenProject::FeatureDecisions.add :new_ui,
    #                                     description: "Enables the new user interface",
    #                                     force_active: true
    #
    # Querying the state of the feature flag:
    #   OpenProject::FeatureDecisions.new_ui_active? # => true or false based on configuration
    #
    # @param [Symbol] flag_name The name of the feature flag to add.
    # @param [String, nil] description A description of the feature flag for documentation purposes.
    # @param [Boolean] force_active Whether to force the feature flag to be active in production or development environments.
    # @return [void]
    ##

    def active
