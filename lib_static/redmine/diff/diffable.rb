#   = Diff
#   (({diff.rb})) - computes the differences between two arrays or
#   strings. Copyright (C) 2001 Lars Christensen
#
#   == Synopsis
#
#       diff = Diff.new(a, b)
#       b = a.patch(diff)
#
#   == Class Diff
#   === Class Methods
#   --- Diff.new(a, b)
#   --- a.diff(b)
#         Creates a Diff object which represent the differences between
#         ((|a|)) and ((|b|)). ((|a|)) and ((|b|)) can be either be arrays
#         of any objects, strings, or object of any class that include
#         module ((|Diffable|))
#
#   == Module Diffable
#   The module ((|Diffable|)) is intended to be included in any class for
#   which differences are to be computed. Diffable is included into String
#   and Array when (({diff.rb})) is (({require}))'d.
#
#   Classes including Diffable should implement (({[]})) to get element at
#   integer indices, (({<<})) to append elements to the object and
#   (({ClassName#new})) should accept 0 arguments to create a new empty
#   object.
#
#   === Instance Methods
#   --- Diffable#patch(diff)
#         Applies the differences from ((|diff|)) to the object ((|obj|))
#         and return the result. ((|obj|)) is not changed. ((|obj|)) and
#         can be either an array or a string, but must match the object
#         from which the ((|diff|)) was created.
