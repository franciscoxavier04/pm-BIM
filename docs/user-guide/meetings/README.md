# Meeting management

Meetings in OpenProject allow you to manage and document your project meetings, prepare a meeting agenda together with your team, and share minutes with attendees - all in one central place.

<div class="glossary">
**Meetings** is defined as a module that allows the organization of meetings.
**Note:** In order to be able to use the meetings plugin, the **Meetings module needs to be activated** in the [Project Settings](../projects/project-settings/modules/).
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With OpenProject 13.1 we introduced dynamic meetings alongside [classic meetings](classic-meetings). 
> With OpenProject 15.3 dynamic meetings are replaced by [one-time meetings](one-time-meetings) and [recurring meetings](recurring-meetings) to further improve meeting management.
> Please keep in mind that the ability to create classic meetings will eventually be removed from OpenProject.

## Meetings in OpenProject

Meetings in OpenProject help teams organise discussions, track meeting agendas, and document decisions efficiently. There are three types of meetings: **one-time meetings**, **recurring meetings**, and **classic meetings**. [One-time meetings](one-time-meetings/) are standalone events scheduled for a specific date and time. [Recurring meetings](recurring-meetings/) introduce a structured way to define a series of related meetings, ensuring consistency and reducing manual setup. [Classic meetings](classic-meetings/) are also standalone events, but are a legacy format that will eventually be phased out.

### Meetings overview

By selecting **Meetings** in the project menu on the left, you get an overview of all the meetings you have been invited to within a specific project sorted by date. By clicking on a meeting name you can view further details of the meeting.

To get an overview of the meetings across multiple projects, you can select **Meetings** in the [global modules menu](../../user-guide/home/global-modules/).

![Select meetings module from openproject global modules ](openproject_userguide_meetings_module_select.png)

Meetings will be grouped based on the meeting start time into the following groups:

- **Today** lists open meetings scheduled for the same day

- **Tomorrow** lists open meetings scheduled for the day after

- **Later this week** lists all open meetings scheduled between two days from now till the end of the week 

- **Next week and later** lists all open meetings scheduled the next week and later

### Meetings filters

The menu on the left will allow you to filter meetings based on following:

- **My meetings** lists all meetings you participate in
- **Recurring meetings** lists all recurring meetings visible to you
- **All meetings** lists all meetings visible to you
- **Meeting series** lists meeting occurrences that are part of recurring meetings
- **Invitations** lists all meetings you are invited to
- **Attended** lists all meetings in which you were marked as having attended
- **Created by me** lists all meetings created by you

The buttons next to *Filters* will allow you to filter for upcoming or past meetings.

You can also use the meetings filters to refine the list of meetings based on the following criteria: 

- **Attended user** - shows meetings that a specific user attended

- **Author** - shows meetings that a specific user created

- **Invited user** - shows meetings that a specific user was invited to

- **Part of a meeting series** - shows meetings that are part of specific meeting series

- **Project** - shows meetings for a specific project (this will only be displayed in the global module view, i.e. not within a specific project)
