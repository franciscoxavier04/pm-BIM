# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for meetings

## What is a difference between a dynamic and classic meeting?

**Dynamic meetings** were introduced with OpenProject 13.1.0 as an improved version of the meetings meant to improve the user experience when managing meetings in OpenProject.

With OpenProject 15.3.0, dynamic meetings can either be [one-time meetings](../one-time-meetings) or [recurring meetings](../recurring-meetings). 

## How long will the classic meetings be available?

[Classic meetings](../classic-meetings) will be deprecated with one of the future releases after 15.3. We will communicate this in advance to ensure a smooth transition for all our users.

## Can I add a meeting to a calendar?

Yes, you can [download a meeting as an iCalendar event](../one-time-meetings/#download-a-meeting-as-an-icalendar-event).

## Are the meetings shown in calendar widgets?

Yes, the Calendar widget on the [project overview page](../../project-overview/#calendar-widget) and [My Page](../../../getting-started/my-page/#add-widgets) displays meetings. Meetings links in this widget are clickable and open the meeting directly.
