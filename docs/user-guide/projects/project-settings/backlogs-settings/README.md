# Backlogs settings

In OpenProject, you can configure your backlogs settings specific to each project.

## Set the definition of done

You can define what "done" means for the Backlogs module. This determines when a work package should be considered complete and included in the burndown (or burnup) chart.

Choose the status which should be treated as "done".

Press the **Save** button to apply your changes.

The **Rebuild positions** button recalculates the position of work packages in the product backlog.
