# Project life cycle

Project phases are defined in [system administration](../../../../system-admin-guide/projects/project-life-cycle).

> [!NOTE] Defining custom project phases is an Enterprise add-on.

You can enable or disable existing project phases by navigating to **Project settings â†’ Project life cycle**.

- Use the toggle switch next to each phase to enable or disable it individually.
- To enable or disable all phases at once, use the **Enable/Disable all** option in the top-right corner of the *Phases* overview.
- Use the search bar to quickly locate specific phases.

> [!NOTE]
>
> A dedicated project permission is required to enable project phases.

When copying a project, the active status of all gates and stages is preserved.
