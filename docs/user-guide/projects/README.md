# Manage projects

In OpenProject you can create projects to collaborate with your team members, track issues, document and share information with stakeholders, organize things. A project is a way to structure and organize your work in OpenProject.

Your projects can be available publicly or internally. OpenProject does not limit the number of projects, neither in the Community edition nor in the Enterprise cloud or in Enterprise on-premises edition.

## Project structure

Projects form a structure in OpenProject. You can have parent projects and sub-projects. A project can represent an organizational unit of a company, e.g. to have issues separated:

* Company (Parent project)
  * Marketing (Sub-project)
  * Sales
  * HR
  * IT
  * ...

Projects can also be for overarching teams working on one topic:

* Launch a new product
  * Design
  * Development
  * ...

Or, a project can be used to separate products or customers.

* Product A
  * Customer A
  * Customer B
  * Customer C

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a [member](../members/#add-members) of a project  to view and work in it.

## Select a project

Find out  [how to open an existing project](../../getting-started/projects/#open-an-existing-project) in OpenProject in our *Getting started* guide.

## Create a new project

Find out how to [create a new project](../../getting-started/projects/#create-a-new-project) in OpenProject in our *Getting started* guide.

## Create a subproject

Find out how to [create a subproject](./project-settings/) in OpenProject in our *Project settings* guide.

## Project Settings

You can specify further advanced settings for your project. Navigate to your project settings by [selecting a project](../../getting-started/projects/#open-an-existing-project), and click -> *Project settings* -> *Information*. Here you can: 

- Define whether the project should have a parent by selecting **Subproject of**. This way, you can [change the project hierarchy](./project-settings/project-information/#change-the-project-hierarchy).

- Enter a detailed description for your project.

- Set the default project **Identifier**. 

- Set a project to **Public**. This means it can be accessed without signing in to OpenProject.
