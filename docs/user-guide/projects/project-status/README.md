# Project status

The project status provides information for you and your team on whether the project is on track, enabling quick action if it's not.

## Set the project status

You can set your project status in the **project settings**. To do this, click Project settings in the left-hand project modules menu and then select the relevant status. To add more information to your project status, you can use the status description field below to manually note changes, project KPIs, or other relevant details.

Alternatively, you can also set the project status on the **project overview** page. If not configured yet, the project status widget appears by default and you can set the project status using the dropdown menu.
