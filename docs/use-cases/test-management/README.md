# Test management in OpenProject

## Purpose

This guide describes how OpenProject can be used for lightweight test management by modeling test plans, test cases, and test runs using built-in features such as work package types, workflows, custom fields and project templates. It enables teams to manage and execute tests within the same environment they already use for project and requirements tracking.

## Scope and assumptions

This use case is intended for teams that:

- Already use OpenProject for project planning and requirements management
- Want to include manual or semi-automated testing workflows
- Need traceability between requirements, test cases, executions, and defects

This setup is not a replacement for full-scale test automation or advanced lab management tools, but rather a structured and integrated approach to test tracking.

> [!NOTE]
>
> At OpenProject, automated testing is a key part of our development process. It helps us detect bugs early and avoid regressions, especially as the codebase grows. We use continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to ensure that changes are tested and released quickly and reliably. You can see our automated test runs on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/opf/openproject/actions). In addition to automated tests, we also perform smoke tests and exploratory testing to cover areas that are harder to automate and to validate the overall user experience. 

## Structure and terminology

![Test management entities](test-management-entities.png)

### Core entities

| Concept            | OpenProject entity                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Requirements       | Work package (e.g., type `Feature` or `User Story`)          |
| Test case          | Work package type `Test Case`                                |
| Test run           | Work package type `Test Run` (child of test case)            |
| Test plan          | Project (created from a [template](../../user-guide/projects/project-templates/)) |
| Version under test | OpenProject [Version](../../user-guide/projects/project-settings/versions/) field on test runs |
| Defect             | Work package (e.g., type `Bug`)                              |

### Relationships

- Each `Feature` or `User Story` may relate to one or more `Test Cases`.
- Each `Test Case` defines a reusable test specification.
- Each `Test Case` has one or more `Test Runs` (child work packages).
- A `Test Run` is specific to one software version.
- `Test Plans` are realized as individual projects per version, created from a reusable template.
- `Bugs` can be linked to failed `Test Runs`.

This structure supports traceability from requirements to execution and defect reporting.

## 1. Test preparation and execution

### 1.1 Creating a test plan (project)

A new test plan project is created based on a predefined template using the [create project form](../../getting-started/projects/#create-a-new-project).

![create test plan](create-test-plan.png)

### 1.2 Adjusting the created test plan 

In the next step the [newly created test plan](https://testmanagement.openproject.com/projects/regression-test-openproject-16-dot-1/work_packages?query_id=90) is adjusted by specifying the test object. The easiest way is to select all work packages (`CMD + A`) -> right click -> `bulk edit`.

* Version of the test object (version ideally shared from the development project)
* Tester
* Environment 

For all test runs which are not planned the status should be adjusted to something like `Not planned`.

![adjust test plan](adjust-test-plan.png)

### 1.3 Test execution

1. Testers open the project corresponding to the release version.
2. Each test run is executed individually:
   - Preconditions are verified
   - Steps are performed
   - Results are recorded
   - Status is updated (e.g., `Passed`, `Test failed`, `Blocked`)
3. If failures occur, related defects (bugs) are created and linked.
4. Boards, filters, or hierarchy views are used to monitor test progress and coverage.
5. The test result can be documented by creating a pdf report of the [test status and results](https://testmanagement.openproject.com/projects/regression-test-openproject-16-dot-1/work_packages?query_id=89).

![create test report](create-test-report.png)

### 1.4 Progress tracking and reporting

As previously stated, agile boards (Kanban or Scrum) can help us track the test execution progress, i.e. visualize `Test Runs` by status (e.g., `To Do` , `In Progress` , `Failed` , `Passed`).

![board-for-test-case-tracking](board-for-test-case-tracking.png)

Comments and activity log (`Activity` tab) complement custom fields in the sense that they can also be used to record:
* Time and date of the execution
* Environment details (e.g., Browser, OS, Build version)
* Qualitative data and detailed explanations, as well as communication and collaboration between testers, developers and other stakeholders around a specific test case.  

Activity tab is especially beneficial during the *static testing* phase. As a reminder, static testing is, among other things, verification of the test cases themselves (sort of testing of test case). Testers review the test cases/test runs searching for inconsistencies, errors, unclarity. Activity tab is a good place to discuss their findings, as well as track the complete and chronological history of a test.

Further tools can be used for reporting and metrics purposes with OpenProject:
* Saved filters: Create and save filters for "Failed Test Cases," "Tests for Feature X," "Tests due this week."
* Export data: Apart from PDF, XLS and CSV are also supported.
* Custom dashboards: On Overview page of your Test plan project, you can create graphs to:
  * Count test cases by status (Passed, Failed, Blocked)
  * Show tests assigned to each tester
  * Track the number of open vs. closed defects, or simply have an overview of the bugs by priority.

### 1.5 Test case evolution: reusability and standardization

As test cases evolve, we need to track changes and reuse them across different cycles. There are several possibilities to achieve this:
* Duplicating work packages, copying projects, creating projects from template, moving work packages to another projects are all good methods for reusing test cases for new test cycles or for creating variations.
* Manual history can be tracked on the activity/comment log for any manual changes to test case steps.
* Naming conventions can be implemented (e.g., "TC-Login-ValidCredentials-v1.0") to help manage variations.

To support consistency and standardization, OpenProject allows administrators to define **automatically generated subjects** for work packages. This feature enables the use of predefined patterns for naming, including for work package types such as `Test Case` and `Test Run`. As a result, newly created test cases and test runs automatically follow a consistent naming structure. This approach helps eliminate manual errors, improves searchability, and enhances filtering capabilities.

The subject pattern can incorporate dynamic attributes from the test case/test run itself (or its parent). In this example, `Test run`'s subject is derived from 2 fields: `Parent's subject` and `Version`.

![Automatically generated subject before saving](automatically-generated-subject-before-saving.png)

Such subject is created upon save and is not manually editable.

![Automatically generated subject after saving](automatically-generated-subject-after-saving2.png)

Automatically generated subjects reduce manual effort and ensure that the name remains accurate and up-to-date if an attribute referenced in the subject pattern changes.

## 2. Test automation with GitHub and GitLab

### 2.1 Integration concept

OpenProject enables seamless integration between software development and test automation workflows in GitHub and GitLab with planning and specification in OpenProject. Work packages can display information from [GitHub pull requests](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/github-integration/) and [GitLab merge requests](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/gitlab-integration) in a dedicated tab.

This tab lists all pull or merge requests linked to a work package, showing their status (e.g., *Ready* or *Merged*) as well as the current state (e.g., *success* or *queued*) of the actions configured to run for each requestâ€”whether in GitHub or GitLab. The results of these actions are also displayed within the tab.

The relationship between work packages and pull/merge requests is many-to-many: a single work package can be linked to multiple pull or merge requests, and a single pull or merge request can be associated with multiple work packages.

### 2.2 Benefits of the integration

Integrating GitHub and GitLab with OpenProject offers several advantages for software development teams:

- **Enhanced traceability**: By linking code changes directly to work packages, teams can easily trace the origin of each change, facilitating better understanding and accountability throughout the development process.
- **Improved collaboration**: Real-time visibility into the status of pull and merge requests fosters collaboration between developers, testers, and project managers, ensuring everyone stays informed and aligned.
- **Streamlined workflows**: Automated updates from GitHub and GitLab reduce manual tracking efforts, allowing teams to focus on development tasks and reducing the likelihood of oversight.
- **Accelerated delivery**: By integrating continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, teams can automate testing and deployment processes, leading to faster and more reliable software releases.
- **Comprehensive reporting**: Consolidated data from development and project management tools enables more comprehensive reporting and analytics, supporting informed decision-making and continuous improvement.

## 3. Configuration guidance
This section provides guidance on how to configure OpenProject for test management. It assumes familiarity with OpenProject administration features.

### 3.1 Configuration example: Test Cases (work package type)

The work package type `Test case` can be configured so it shows the relevant information:

* Test runs (related work packages table `children`)
* Tested features (related work packages `requires`)
* Priority
* Tested module (custom field of type `Hierarchy`)

Here you find an [example for a test case](https://testmanagement.openproject.com/wp/37).



![test case configuration example](test-case-configuration-example.png)

### 3.2 Configuration example: Test Run (work package type)

The work package type `Test run` can be configured so it shows the relevant information:

* Test specification including preconditions, excecution steps and test results: Description field
* Tested features (related work packages `requires`)
* Priority
* Tester (custom field of type user)
* Identified bugs (related work packages `related to`)

Here you find an [example for a test run](https://testmanagement.openproject.com/wp/65).

![test run configuration example](test-run-configuration-example.png)


### 3.3 Roles and permissions

- Define useful roles such as:
  - `Tester`
  -  `Test Manager`

- Add permissions such as:
  - Edit work packages

### 3.4 Custom fields

Define custom fields that describe the test object such as:

- Test environment (type `hierarchy`)
- Tester (custom field type `user`)

### 3.5 Workflow and statuses

- Define custom statuses such as:
  - `New`,
  - `In progress`
  - `Test passed`
  - `Test failed`
  - ...
- Create a simple workflow for test runs with allowed transitions
- Optionally restrict who can move a test run to `Test passed`.
