# Introduction to agile boards

This document provides an initial introduction to the boards in OpenProject, i.e. how to use a Kanban board to manage your tasks in an agile way. To learn more about working with Boards in OpenProject, please visit our [user guide for boards](../../user-guide/agile-boards).

> [!NOTE]
> The basic agile boards are included in the OpenProject Community edition. OpenProject advanced Action boards are an Enterprise add-on and can only be used  with [Enterprise cloud](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-cloud-guide) or [Enterprise on-premises](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-on-premises-guide). An upgrade from the free Community edition is easily possible.

**Boards** in OpenProject enable agile project management, i.e. Kanban. Boards consist of lists (columns) with cards (work packages) on it. They help to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).

## What is a Board?

Agile Boards in OpenProject support teams in their agile project management methodology, e.g. Scrum or Kanban.

You can create as many flexible boards as you want with both lists and cards on it. A list usually represents a workflow, e.g. status or version of a work package. The cards are work packages, e.g. tasks, on this list.

## Manage your work in a Board

To manage your work in an agile board, open the boards module in the project menu. Choose a board from the list where you want to work on. Open it by double clicking the board's title.

You can prioritize cards within a list via drag and drop, add new cards and update cards status directly in a board. To edit the details of a card, double click it.
