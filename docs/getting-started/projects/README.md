# Projects introduction

Get an introduction how to work with projects in OpenProject. To start collaboration in OpenProject, you first have to set up a new project.

<div class="glossary">

A **project** is defined as a temporary, goal-driven effort to create a unique output. A project has clearly defined phases, a start and an end date, and its success is measured by whether it meets its stated objectives.
A project in OpenProject can be understood as a project as defined above. Also, it can be set up as a "workspace" for teams to collaborate on one common topic, e.g. to organize a department.

</div>

>  [!NOTE]
>
> In order to see a project and work in it, you have to be a [member of the project](../invite-members).

## Open an existing project

In order to open an existing project, click the **All projects** dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the header and select the project you want to open.

You can also start typing in a project name to filter by the project's title or filter for favorite projects.

Projects and subprojects are displayed according to their hierarchy in the drop-down menu.

<div class="glossary">

**Subproject** is defined as a child project of another project. Subprojects can be used to display a hierarchy of projects. Several filter options (e.g. in work package table and timeline) can be applied only to the current project and its subprojects.

</div>

Alternatively, you can open the list of all existing projects using the [**Global modules**](../../user-guide/home/global-modules/#projects) menu.

Also, you will see your newest and favored projects on the application landing page in the **Projects** section. Here you can simply click on one of the projects to open it. Alternatively, select favorite projects from the **All projects** dropdown menu by using the respective switch.

There are several ways to create a new project in OpenProject. 

1. Click the green button **+ Project** directly on the system's home screen in the **Project** section.

4. In addition, can also create a new project on the [project lists](../../user-guide/projects/project-lists/) overview page. 

- You can either create a completely new project, a subproject of an existing project or a (sub)project from a template. For the latter option, choose a [template](../../user-guide/projects/project-templates/#create-a-project-template) using the drop-down menu.
- Enter a **name** for your project and click the **Create** button.
- Integrate the project into the existing project hierarchy by defining it as a subproject of an existing project.
- The **Advanced settings** allow for further configuration, e.g. description, URL, etc.

By default, creating a new project will set you as project admin, regardless of whether you copied a project, used a template or created a project from scratch. Now, you can get started working on your project.

To configure further project information, see the documentation for [project settings](../../user-guide/projects/project-settings/project-information/).

### View all projects

To view all your projects in which you are a member, click on the **Project lists** button at the bottom of the action bar after opening the **Select a project** drop-down menu.
