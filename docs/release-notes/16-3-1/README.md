# OpenProject 16.3.1

Release date: 2025-08-13

We released OpenProject [OpenProject 16.3.1](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2218).

A bug was identified that prevents the user account menu from displaying correctly if you use a [direct login provider](../../system-admin-guide/authentication/login-registration-settings/) instead of the standard login form.
If you are not using a direct login provider, you are not affected by this.

The release also contains some additional bug fixes that were not ready in time for the 16.3.0 release.

Below, we will give an overview of all bug fixes
