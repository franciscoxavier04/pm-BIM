# OpenProject 16.0.0

Release date: 2025-05-21

We released [OpenProject 16.0.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/1412). This major release contains many features and bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important updates, important feature changes and important technical updates. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes for 16.0.0.

## Important updates

The Enterprise plans (Basic, Professional, Premium, and Corporate) have been updated. Each plan now includes a specific set of Enterprise add-ons. Support levels and pricing remain unchanged with version 16.0.

Current Enterprise customers retain their existing plans with access to all Enterprise add-ons available at that time. No features are removed. From this version onward, new Enterprise add-ons may be included only in higher-tier plans. For example, the new [Internal comments feature](#internal-comments-in-work-packages-enterprise-add-on) is part of the Professional plan.

Customers on lower Enterprise plans who want to try out new add-ons from higher plans can do so by [requesting a new Enterprise trial token (on-premises)](https://www.openproject.org/contact/) or by [starting a new Cloud trial instance](https://start.openproject.com/).

More details are available in our updated [Pricing page](https://www.openproject.org/pricing).

## Important feature changes

## Meeting backlogs

Meeting organization becomes even easier with OpenProject 16.0: Meeting backlogs allow users to collect, manage, and prepare agenda items more flexibly — both for one-time meetings and for recurring meeting series.

In one-time meetings, the new [**Agenda backlog**](../../user-guide/meetings/one-time-meetings/#agenda-backlogs) stores topics that are not yet assigned to the current meeting but may be added later.

![A one-time meeting in OpenProject with an Agenda backlog and info to 'Drag items here or create a new one'.](openproject-16-0-meeting-backlogs-one-time-highlighted.png)

In recurring meetings, the shared [**Series backlog**](../../user-guide/meetings/recurring-meetings/#meeting-backlogs-for-recurring-meetings) helps track open points across all meeting occurrences and move items between them as priorities change.

![A recurring meeting in OpenProject with a Series backlog and and options to Edit, add notes, Move to current meeting or Remove from agenda.](openproject-16-0-meeting-backlogs-recurring-options.png)

Agenda items can easily be moved from the backlog to a meeting — or back to the backlog if an agenda item needs to be postponed. Work packages can also be added directly to the backlog. Even meetings without current agenda items can maintain a backlog of important topics.

Meeting backlogs support better preparation, more flexibility, and a clearer structure for meeting management in OpenProject.

### End of classic meetings

With version 16.0, the 'classic’ option will no longer be offered when creating a new meeting in OpenProject. With the release of meeting outcomes and now also meeting backlogs, classic meetings are considered outdated.

No data will get lost with the update, apart from the Meeting history of your classic meetings. If you used classic meetings in the past, see [this blog article](https://www.openproject.org/blog/end-classic-meetings-may-2025/) to learn more about the change and the reasons behind it.

## Internal comments in work packages (Enterprise add-on)

Users of the Enterprise Professional version are now able to communicate internally in the work package Activity tab. To use this feature, a project admin has to enable internal comments. By default, these are only visible to the project admin role, but administrators can grant a new set of permissions to any number of roles.

All users with these permissions then see an "Internal comment" checkbox when adding a new comment. If they check this box, the comment will only be visible to other people with these permissions. The different background color indicates that a comment is internal.

![OpenProject work package with open Activity tab, a comment from a user and a not yet submitted comment with confidential content where the checkmark for Internal comment is activated.](openproject-16-0-internal-comment.png)

> [!TIP]
> To check who is able to see your internal comment, type '@' and you will see a list of all users that have the permission to see internal comments. If a user is not in that list, you will not be able to @mention them.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with 16.0, **files uploaded in the Activity tab will not be included in the Files tab**. Even though internal comments are the technical trigger for this change, it applies to both regular and internal comments.

Find out more about [internal comments in this user guide](../../user-guide/activity/#internal-comments-enterprise-add-on) and [this blog article](https://www.openproject.org/blog/internal-comments/).

## Automatically generated work package subjects (Enterprise add-on)

OpenProject now supports automatically generated subjects for work packages. This new Enterprise add-on, available in the Professional plan, allows administrators to define subject patterns for each work package type. When enabled, the subject field is **filled automatically and becomes non-editable during work package creation and updates**.

![Two screenshots: One showing the administration for a work package type 'Candidate interview' with the subject pattern /Candidate with /Assignee on /Start date. One showing a work package of the type Candidate interview with an automatically generated work package subject following that pattern - "Lydia Schiffer with Cyril Dupont on 2025-05-26"](openproject-16-0-automatically-generated-work-package-subjects-candidate-interview-explained.png)

This is especially useful for structured processes such as vacation requests, IT tickets, or maintenance reports, where consistent naming is required. Subject patterns can include static text as well as dynamic placeholders like project name, work package type, or custom field values.

## Separate time tracking module with calendar view

OpenProject 16.0 offers a separate time tracking module with a calendar view. It is accessible from the global view and listed in the left side bar navigation called [My time tracking](../../user-guide/my-time-tracking/). There, users can view and edit their logged time with start and end times. The user can switch between daily, weekly, work week and monthly views and also log new time entries directly by clicking in the calendar.

Each day shows the sum of the tracked time, and in the weekly and monthly views, the total tracked time is displayed in the lower right corner.

![OpenProject's My time tracking module in calendar view, showing a work week with different time entries.](openproject-16-0-my-time-tracking-work-week-final.png)

Please note that this module has to be activated by an administrator first. Navigate to *Administration → Time and costs → Defaults* and check the box next to 'Allow exact time tracking' to enable tracking start and finish dates. If 'Allow exact time tracking' is enabled, the calendar becomes the default view for the My time tracking module. If 'Require exact times' is checked, users must provide both start and end times when logging time. Otherwise, the list view remains the default. In the calendar view, all entries are then displayed at the top of the respective day column.

Learn more about My time tracking module in [this user guide](../../user-guide/my-time-tracking/) and [this blog article](https://www.openproject.org/blog/time-tracking-module/).

### Time entries with legally required mandatory fields: start time and finish time

Time reports now include explicit start and end times, addressing common legal requirements. Before 16.0, time reports showed only the total duration of logged time. Now, they also include start and end times for greater accuracy. This applies to all features where time tracking is possible, e.g. the new time tracking module, PDF timesheets, or the My spent time widget.

### Overview of time logged per day per user in PDF timesheet

Exported PDF timesheets now include an overview of logged time per day and user. It is displayed in a table view at the beginning of the report. If the list contains more than five users, the view is split into several tables.

![Example PDF timesheet showing different times logged by five different people in a table view](openproject-16-0-timesheet-hours-user-day.png)

## Release to Community: Graphs on project overview page

From time to time an Enterprise add-on is released for the free Community version. We are happy to announce that with OpenProject 16.0, the **graphs on the project overview page are now available in all editions**. This means that Community users can now display graphs directly on the project overview page to visualize important project information and communicate project status to the team and management.

The work package graph widgets display information about the work packages within a project and can be shown in different views, such as bar graphs or pie charts.

[Learn more about this feature in our user guide](../../user-guide/project-overview/#work-package-graph-widgets).

![Different graphs displayed on a project overview page in OpenProject: Work package status in a pie chart, work packages progress in a graph with percentages, closed + open work packages sorted by type and number of assignees.](openproject-project-reports.png)

## Parent relation displayed in work package relations tab

As requested by our users, you can now add a parent work package relation by choosing it directly from the dropdown menu in the Relations tab. This is also still possible by clicking on **Set parent** on the top left corner of a work package. Both will make the related work package a parent of the current (child) work package.

![Dropdown in work package Relations tab, showing highlighted Parent relation.](openproject-16-0-parent-relation.png)

## Save work package export configuration

When [exporting a (public or private) work package table](../../user-guide/work-packages/exporting/), users can now save their configuration settings, e.g. a specific order and display of columns or long text fields. This saves time and allows users to share the export settings with their team (e.g. for a defects and approval report). Please note that this setting is not individual and will **change the default configuration for this specific format and type for everyone**.

![OpenProject work package table export modal with a highlighted checkbox to save settings.](openproject-16-0-save-export-settings-highlighted.png)

## Storage Health status: Multiple visible checks and download option

The Health check for file storages has been extended in OpenProject 16.0. Administrators can now view **multiple visible results**, grouped into base configuration, authentication, and automatically-managed folders. Each group displays a short summary indicating whether all checks passed, warnings occurred, or failures were detected. If issues are found, a link to detailed documentation is provided.

The summary of the most recent health check remains visible in the sidebar. In addition, a new option allows administrators to open a **full detailed report** to review all individual checks directly.

To make troubleshooting even easier, administrators can now also **download** the complete health check report as a text file, for example to include in a support request.

## Option to select favorite project tab as default in project quick search

When selecting the **Favorites** tab in the Projects dropdown, OpenProject now remembers this preference and shows it by default the next time the dropdown is opened. It is a personal setting that remains active until the user switches back to **All**. This small usability improvement saves time for users who frequently work with favorite projects.

## Important technical changes

## Seamless integration of user sessions of Nextcloud and OpenProject using OIDC & JWTs (Enterprise add-on)

OpenProject 16.0 introduces a major improvement for customers of the Enterprise Corporate plan that are using Nextcloud alongside OpenProject. Through a new configuration based on OpenID Connect (OIDC) and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), OpenProject and Nextcloud can now integrate user sessions seamlessly without showing separate consent screens in each application.

Instead of mutually acting as OAuth servers and clients, both OpenProject and Nextcloud can now authenticate against a common Identity Provider (IDP). This allows OpenProject to reuse the user session to call Nextcloud APIs directly — improving the user experience and reducing complexity in daily workflows.

Please see [our system admin guide](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/nextcloud/oidc-sso/) to learn how to set up this integration.

This is the first version of OpenProject to support this new integration method with Nextcloud. Since this feature was not yet
exposed to large installations, we still consider it experimental. Please share your feedback regarding this new feature with us and stay tuned
for further enhancements around it.

## Breaking: API requests with JWT issued by OpenID Connect provider require scope

In [OpenProject 14.4.0](../../release-notes/14/14-0-0/) we introduced the possibility to access the OpenProject API through a JSON Web Token created by an OpenID Connect
provider. Back then we only intended them to be used in the context of our APIv3. However, as OpenProject evolves further, we want to
be able to use them in additional contexts. Starting with OpenProject 16.0.0, we will therefore require all tokens to carry a scope called
`api_v3` for API requests to our APIv3. This is consistent with other tokens issued by OpenProject itself.
