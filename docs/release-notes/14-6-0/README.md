# OpenProject 14.6.0

Release date: 2024-10-09

We released OpenProject [OpenProject 14.6.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2111). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. 

In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important feature changes

### Updated progress reporting with most flexible options

In response to valuable user feedback, OpenProject 14.6 brings important changes to progress reporting. We greatly appreciate the input from our Community, which helped shape these updates. Based on your feedback, the % Complete field is now manually editable again in work-based mode (like it has been in the versions before 14.0), removing the previous requirement to input Work or Remaining Work. This gives users more flexibility in tracking project progress.

But we did not only revise the changes we made with 14.0, we also added new options to enhance progress tracking and make it most flexible for our users. This is why, additionally, administrators now have new settings for progress calculation and % Complete hierarchy totals:

If you use our progress tracking, we advise reading [this detailed article about progress reporting with OpenProject 14.6](https://www.openproject.org/blog/updates-to-progress-tracking-in-14-6-based-on-user-feedback/) from our product team.

### Meetings: Receive an update notification with reload option

If you have not used our Meetings module, you should consider starting it now. We updated dynamic meetings so that you now receive a notification whenever someone else made changes to the meeting you're looking at. Click on the button included in the notification to reload the page. This is a particularly great improvement for teams who work simultaneously in meetings.

Please note that if you reload the page, any unsaved changes you have made will be lost. We therefore recommend that you save your changes before clicking the Reload button, or even save them in a different location if they are extensive.

### Enable and disable a custom field for multiple projects at once

In OpenProject 14.6, administrators can now save time by enabling or disabling custom fields for multiple projects simultaneously. This feature streamlines the process of managing custom fields across projects, making it easier and more efficient for administrators.

A new tab navigation has been introduced under *Administration* > *Custom Fields*, similar to the project attributes interface. This section displays a list of all projects where a specific custom field is activated. Administrators can easily add or remove projects from the list using a menu within each row, without the need for confirmation. 

Additionally, users can include sub-projects when adding, which automatically selects all sub-projects within the hierarchy. Already added projects are visible but deactivated in the dropdown.

Learn more about [custom fields and how to create them](../../user-guide/projects/project-settings/custom-fields/) in our user guide.

### Use relative work package attribute macros

In OpenProject 14.6, users can now use descriptions with embedded macros. This feature ensures consistent descriptions across work packages and eliminates the need to manually replace placeholders for each work package attribute.

This is particularly helpful if you want to work with templates, as the copied work package automatically references its own attributes. Also, this feature will be very helpful for the [upcoming feature to generate PDFs from work package descriptions](https://community.openproject.org/wp/45896).

Macros such as *workPackageValue:assignee* have been implemented, allowing the dynamic display of work package specific values like the assignee directly in the template. These macros support both work package and project values and labels, making it easier to generate consistent and accurate documentation. Of course, you can still reference a specific work package by including the ID (e.g. *workPackageValue:1234:assignee*).

![Screenshot showing a work package with macros in the description](openproject-14-6-macros.png)

See our [documentation for a list of available attributes for work packages](../../user-guide/wysiwyg/#available-attributes-for-work-packages) and take a look at [this blog article to learn more about using macros with OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/blog/how-to-use-macros/).

### Show empty lines in saved rich text

Before 14.6, OpenProject's editors, such as in the work package description, did automatically delete empty lines when saved. Now, empty rows are shown in show mode, edit mode, and are not removed when saving text fields.

### See past meetings included in the number next to the Meetings tab

On the Meetings tab in the split screen view, the number next to the “Meetings (2)” tab should include both current and past meetings. Previously, only future meetings were counted. So if you use the Meetings module and reference work packages there, you may notice a higher number on the work package tab for meetings.
### Changes to design settings in administration
[Design settings in OpenProject administration](../../system-admin-guide/design) were split into several sections, to make navigation easier and eliminate scrolling down the page to find the correct setting.
