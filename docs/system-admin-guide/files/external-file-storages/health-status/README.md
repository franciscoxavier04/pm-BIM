# Health status checks and troubleshooting

If a file storage is not working as expected, you can find additional information about possible errors in the details
view of the file storage. You can access this view by clicking on the file storage's name in the list under
*Administration* → *Files* → *External file storages*. There, administrators can manually trigger a connection
validation and receive a health status report, or review any errors reported by background synchronization workers
needed for file storages with automatically managed project folders.

## Connection validation

Every file storage is able to run a connection test. This test is triggered manually by clicking on **Run checks now**
in the sidebar on the right side of the file storage's details view. This check is available after the file storage is
fully configured.

After the check has run, a brief summary is displayed. For more details the administrator can open the full report by
clicking on **Open full health report**.

There are several possible errors that can occur during the connection test. While some errors can occur for all types
of file storages, most errors are quite specific for the provider type. The following table lists the error codes
that can happen on all files storages.

| Error code         | Error description                         | Possible reasons                                                            | Next steps and solutions                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ERR_NOT_CONFIGURED | The file storage is not fully configured. | Important data is missing, so that the file storage is labelled incomplete. | Check the input fields and fill in the missing data.                                                                                     |
| ERR_UNKNOWN_ERROR  | An unknown error occurred.                | There can be multiple reasons and the error source was not foreseen.        | Errors of this kind are logged to the server logs. Look for a log entry starting with `Connection validation failed with unknown error:` |

### Error codes specific for OneDrive/SharePoint

The following table lists the error codes of failures specific for OneDrive/SharePoint, with a description of the
possible reasons and suggested solutions.

### Error codes specific for file storages with SSO configuration

Some file storages can be configured to use SSO login methods. There are a couple of checks run explicitly for this kind
of setup. The following table contains the error codes of those checks.

| WRN_OFFLINE_ACCESS_SCOPE_MISSING | The OIDC provider has no `offline_access` scope.           | The OIDC provider was configured without `offline_access` scope. While this does not cause the integration to break, this scope ensures, that refresh tokens to not expire and OpenProject can maintain a connection. | Add the scope `offline_access` to the OIDC provider configuration.                                                           |

## Health checks for automatically managed project folders

File storages with the *Automatically managed project folders* option will have reoccurring synchronization
runs, that update the user permissions on the external system and report possible errors. An additional section is
displayed for those file storages in the side bar.

![Health check for automatically managed folders in file storage integrations in OpenProject](openproject_file_storages_health_message.png)

If a problem has been detected, the OpenProject administrators will be notified of the detected error via email.
Administrators will be notified of the faulty integration once a day, including the specific error description and
solution suggestions (see the table below).

Once the error has been resolved, the administrators will also receive an email informing them of this.

You can choose to subscribe or unsubscribe to these email notifications by clicking the respective button under the
error message.
