        Returned if the activity does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
        to see it.

        **Required permission:**
        - `view_work_packages`
        - for internal comments: `view_internal_comments`

        *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of an activity.
        That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*
