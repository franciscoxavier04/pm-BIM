  Project phases separate the whole of the project's duration into smaller, distinct parts.
  Such a phase will then have different focus on certain aspects of project management. E.g. while the first phase might be about gathering requirements, the second phase might be about implementing the requirements
  and the third phase might be about testing the implementation.

  The phases within the projects rely on an abstract definition of the project life cycle valid in a number of projects within the OpenProject instance.
  That definition is a set of ProjectPhaseDefinitions.
