  Project phases separate the whole of the project's duration into smaller, distinct parts where each phase has its own start and end date.
  Such a phase will then have different focus on certain aspects of project management. E.g. while the first phase might be about gathering requirements, the second phase might be about implementing the requirements
  and the third phase might be about testing the implementation.

  Phases within a project are concrete instances of a phase definition. That way, one or a number of project life cycles can be defined throughout the OpenProject instance and then be reused in different projects.
  Projects can enable or disable the use of a phase definition in a project and assign dates to the phase instances.
