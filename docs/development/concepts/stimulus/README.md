# Using  Stimulus

In a decision to move OpenProject towards the [Hotwire approach](https://hotwired.dev/), we introduced [Stimulus.js](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev) to replace a collection of dynamically loaded custom JavaScript files used to sprinkle some interactivity.

This guide will outline how to add controllers and the conventions around it. This is _not_ a documentation of stimulus itself. Use their [documentation](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev) instead.

## Adding controllers

All controllers live under `frontend/src/stimulus/controllers/`. The naming convention is `<controller-name>.controller.ts`, meaning to dasherize the name of the controller. This makes it easier to generate names and classes using common IDEs.

If you want to add a common pattern, manually register the controller under `frontend/src/stimulus/setup.ts`. Often you'll want to have a dynamically loaded controller instead though.

### Adding a static controller from a plugin

If you want to add a stimulus controller from plugin code, you can do so by manually adding it to the preregister:

```typescript
import { OpenProjectStimulusApplication } from 'core-app/stimulus/app';
import { MyTestControllerClass } from './test/foo/my-test.controller';
  

OpenProjectStimulusApplication.preregister(
  'test',
  MyTestControllerClass
);
```

### Dynamically loaded controllers

To dynamically load a controller, it needs to live under `frontend/src/stimulus/controllers/dynamic/<controller-name>.controller.ts`.
The application controller (`frontend/src/stimulus/controllers/op-application.controller.ts`) will automatically load controllers dynamically if they are not registered in the `setup.ts` file.

```html
<div data-controller="users"></div>
```

#### Namespacing dynamic controllers

If you want to organize your dynamic controllers in a subfolder, use the [double dash convention](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/installing#controller-filenames-map-to-identifiers) of stimulus. For example, adding a new admin controller `settings`, you'd do the following:

1. Add the controller under `frontend/src/stimulus/controllers/dynamic/admin/settings.controller.ts`
2. Specify the controller name with a double dash for each folder

```html
<div data-controller="admin--settings"></div>
```

You need to take care to prefix all actions, values etc. with the exact same pattern, e.g., `data-admin--settings-target="foobar"`.

#### Dynamically loading controllers from plugins

If you want to add a dynamic stimulus controller import from plugin code, you can do so by manually adding it to the preregister:

```typescript
import { OpenProjectStimulusApplication } from 'core-app/stimulus/app';

OpenProjectStimulusApplication.preregisterDynamic(
  'test',
  () => import('./test.controller')
);
```

This ensures that the controller is loaded only when it is needed, and not at application startup. The controller will then be enabled when the `data-controller` attribute is present in the DOM through the same mechanism as for the core dynamic controllers.

### Requiring a page controller

If you have a single controller used in a partial, we have added a helper to use in a partial in order to append a controller to the `#content-wrapper` tag. This is useful if your template doesn't have a single DOM root. For example, to load the dynamic `project-storage-form` controller and provide a custom value to it:

```erb
<% content_controller 'project-storage-form',
                      'project-storage-form-folder-mode-value': @project_storage.project_folder_mode %>
```
