# Create an OpenProject trial installation

You can easily set up a **14-day free trial** for the OpenProject Enterprise cloud edition.

Here you can test all OpenProject functionalities thoroughly. After 14 days the trial will expire automatically and will be deleted after a short period of time. No further action is required on your part. This allows you to test OpenProject freely and without any concerns.

## Start a new trial installation

To create a new OpenProject trial, either go to the [OpenProject website](https://www.openproject.org/) or open the [start trial page](https://start.openproject.com).

**Enter your organization domain**. This name will become part of the URL of your OpenProject installation, for example `myneworganization.openproject.com`.

You can include a hyphen "-" in the organization name, e.g. *my-new-organization.openproject.com*. 

> [!TIP]
> We also support [custom domains](../enterprise-cloud-faq/#can-i-get-a-custom-domain-name-instead-of-exampleopenprojectcom). 

Next, specify your **Email** and **Team language** preferences. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that the OpenProject [privacy policy](https://www.openproject.org/legal/privacy/) and the [terms of service](https://www.openproject.org/legal/terms-of-service/) apply if you create a trial instance.

Click the **Continue** button to proceed.

> [!TIP]
> Do not close the browser window or turn off your device while you wait.
