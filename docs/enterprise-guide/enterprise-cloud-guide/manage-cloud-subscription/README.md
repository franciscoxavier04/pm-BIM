Here you can choose the new amount of users. Your next payment will be displayed below.

You can **upgrade an existing subscription** in increments of 5 at any time. Additional users will be billed on a prorated basis, this means you will only pay for the additional users for the rest of the current subscription period.

You can **downgrade a subscription** to the end of a current subscription period. This means the downgrade becomes active with the next payment term.

Click the **Update your subscription now** button to save the changes.
