    # There is a bug in scimitar gem.
    # When "$ref" sub-attribute is present then scim_reosource cannot be intialized
    # Firstly it fails because $ref is not part of the schema.
    # Secondly if it has been added to the schema then "$ref" cannot be a parameter for `attr_accessor` call.
    # Hopefully helpful code links:
    # 1. https://github.com/pond/scimitar/blob/09b284778340ee067df9e5140d0230386afb9992/app/controllers/scimitar/resources_controller.rb#L176C25-L176C38
    # 2. https://github.com/pond/scimitar/blob/09b284778340ee067df9e5140d0230386afb9992/app/models/scimitar/schema/derived_attributes.rb#L13C13-L13C42
    #
    # Therefore, before scimitar accepts "$ref" sub-attributes we just remove them from payload.
