  # This method is part of a nasty workaround for creating and updating SCIM clients:
  # To be able to validate the jwt_sub, the SetAttributesService must be able to effectively set the jwt_sub,
  # before it's validated by a contract. Afterwards the UpdateService must be able to persist the change. Since
  # user_auth_provider_links is a has_many association, there is no built-in memoization for values. So to make sure the
  # SetAttributesService, the Contract and the UpdateService all look at the same jwt_sub, we memoize the auth_provider_link here
