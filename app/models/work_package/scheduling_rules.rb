  # Calculates the minimum date that will not violate the precedes relations
  # (max(finish date, start date) + relation lag) of this work package or its
  # ancestors
  #
  # Lag is the number of non working days between 2 work packages of a
  # follows/precedes relation.
  #
  # For instance:
  #          AP -------------- precedes ----- A
  # (due_date: 2017/07/25)     (lag: 0)       |
  #                                         parent
  #                                           |
  #          BP -------------- precedes ----- B
  # (due_date: 2017/07/22)     (lag: 2)       |
  #                                         parent
  #                                           |
  #          CP -------------- precedes ----- C
  # (due_date: 2017/07/25)     (lag: 2)
  #
  # Then successor_soonest_start for each relation is:
  #   A is 2017/07/26 (AP due date: 25, no lag => 26)
  #   B is 2017/07/27 (BP due date: 22, 23 and 24 are non-working days, 25 and 26 is the 2 days lag => 27)
  #   C is 2017/07/28 (CP due date: 25, 26 and 27 is the 2 days lag => 28)
  #
  # The soonest start for this work package is the maximum of these values: 2017/07/28.
  #
  # @param working_days_from [WorkPackage, nil] the work package for which to
  #   find the next working day after the soonest start given by the scheduling
  #   relations. If nil, the work package itself is used. Useful for a work
  #   package calculating the soonest start given by its parent as it may have a
  #   different `ignore_working_days` value than its parent.
