# A contract that allows to compose itself from other contracts like:
#
#     class MyContract < ComposedContract
#       include_contract MyOtherContractA
#       include_contract MyOtherContractB
#     end
#
# This allows to run the smaller contracts separately, but also to have one contract
# that validates the model as a whole. The composed contract will make sure that all attributes
# defined as writable in one contract are also considered writable in other contracts.
#
# It's not possible to add validations to the composed contract directly. If you need additional validations,
# extract them into a separate contract that you include in the composed contract.
