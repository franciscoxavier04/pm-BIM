      # ```

      #     # Title used unless it is overwritten for the specific feature

      #       [feature_key]:
      #         # Title used for this feature only. If this is missing, the default title is used.
      #         title: "A splendid feature"
      #         # Could also be description_html if necessary
      #         description: "This is a splendid feature that you should use. It just might transform your life."
      #         # Title of the link used for this feature only. If this is missing, the default link title is used.
      #         title_link: "Even more information"

      #           some_other_key: "Some other feature"
      # ```
      # You can also provide a custom i18n_scope to change the place where the component looks for
      # title, description, and features.
      #
      # To provide a video or image, use the respective `video:` or `image:` tags.
      # If none or provided, a default image will be used.
