      # have the assorted data structures match the expectations.
      # The text will be fetched from the i18n files:
      # ```
      # en:
      #   ee:
      #     # Title used unless it is overwritten for the specific feature
      #     title: "Enterprise add-on"
      #     upsell:
      #       [feature_key]:
      #         # Title used for this feature only. If this is missing, the default feature key is used.
      #         title: "A splendid feature"
      #         # Could also be description_html if necessary
      #         description: "This is a splendid feature that you should use. It just might transform your life."
      #         # An unordered list of features
      #         features:
      #           some_key: "Some feature"
      #           some_other_key: "Some other feature"
      # ```

      # title, description, and features.
      #
