This document outlines our principles for using HTML links within our application. These guidelines align with our [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/product/components/link/accessibility/#accessibility-and-usability-expectations) to ensure consistency, accessibility, and a user-friendly experience.

# Link Target Behavior

By default, all links **open in the same browser tab**. This maintains user context and supports a seamless navigation experience.

There are **two exceptions** where links may open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`):

* The link points to an **external platform** (e.g., Nextcloud).
* Opening the link in the same tab would **break the current user flow**, such as during form completion.

When a link opens in a new tab, the following must be implemented:

* An **`aria-label`** must be added to inform screen reader users that the link opens in a new tab (e.g., `"Opens in a new tab"`).
* The link must be followed by the `link-external` icon to visually indicate that a new tab will open.

# Inline Link Styling

Links that are part of a paragraph or continuous text must be **underlined**. This ensures they are clearly distinguishable from surrounding text, which is especially important for users with color vision deficiencies.
For links in form captions and PageHeader descriptions, this is done automatically. Other than that, it has to be done [manually](https://primer.style/view-components/lookbook/inspect/primer/beta/link/default) by setting `underline: true`.
