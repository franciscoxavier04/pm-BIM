OpenProject provides several ways to layout your page.

## Layout component

On a primerized page, you may want to use the `Primer::Beta::Layout` component, which will give
you a layout with a side panel and a main content area, stacking behavior for mobile, and more.

### Component overview

These are the involved primer components:

- `Primer::Beta::Layout` - The main layout component. For more information, see the [Primer docs](https://primer.style/product/getting-started/rails/components/layout/) and [the preview for the component](/lookbook/inspect/primer/alpha/layout/playground)
- `Primer::OpenProject::SidePanel` - SidePanel component for one or multiple sections. Please have a look at the docs for the [SidePanel component](./../components/side_panel).

Here is an example on how this would be used:

<%= embed Patterns::LayoutPreview, :default, panels: %i[source] %>
