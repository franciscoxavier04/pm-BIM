Settings pages usually have content space that stretches to the full width of the viewport, as there is no other element
horizontally positioned, except the left side menu.

## Settings page base component

According to the [form width specification](./forms), we avoid forms to stretch without limit. Because of the default
behaviour of form elements to use the full width of the container, we use a base component that embeds the form inside
such a wrapping container.

Any view component rendering a form should inherit from `AdminSettingsFormComponent`. The template stays unchanged. This
way, the rendered form is wrapped into a container with `480px` max-width.

```ruby
module WorkPackages
  module Types
    class SettingsComponent < AdminSettingsFormComponent
      # component logic goes here
    end
  end
end
```

```erb
<%%=
  primer_form_with(**form_options) do |f|
    render(WorkPackages::Types::SettingsForm.new(f))
  end
%>
```
