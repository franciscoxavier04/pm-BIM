Settings pages usually stretch to the full width of the viewport as they tend not to have addition horizontally-positioned elements.

## Settings page base component

As specified in the documentation for [forms](./forms), we prefer limiting the width of a form for legibility. Because the default
behaviour of form elements to fill the full width of the container, we wrap forms in a container that limits its available width.

Any view component rendering a form should inherit from `AdminSettingsFormComponent`. The template stays unchanged. This
way, the rendered form is wrapped into a container with `680px` max-width.

```ruby
module WorkPackages
  module Types
    class SettingsComponent < AdminSettingsFormComponent
      # component logic goes here
    end
  end
end
```

```erb
<%%=
  primer_form_with(**form_options) do |f|
    render(WorkPackages::Types::SettingsForm.new(f))
  end
%>
```
