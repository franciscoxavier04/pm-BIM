Settings pages usually stretch to the full width of the viewport as they tend not to have addition horizontally-positioned elements.

## Settings page form helper

As specified in the documentation for [forms](./forms), we prefer limiting the width of a form for legibility. Because the default behaviour of form elements to fill the full width of the container, we wrap forms in a container that limits its available width.

Any view component rendering a form should use the the `admin_settings_primer_form_with` form helper instead of the standard `primer_form_with`. The form itself stays unchanged. This
way, the rendered form is wrapped into a container with `680px` max-width.

```erb
<%%=
  admin_settings_primer_form_with(**form_options) do |f|
    render(WorkPackages::Types::SettingsForm.new(f))
  end %>
```

As a general rule, only _free-floating_ forms should use this wrapper.

Forms that are contained inside box-components (eg. setting up or editing a File store or an OpenID provider) do not need this wrapper; they can stretch to the full width of the box table they are contained in. Individual elements will of course have their own width setting.
