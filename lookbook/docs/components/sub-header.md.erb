This component is an own implementation for OpenProject requirements of contextual elements that affect the content of the page below. Such a component does not exist in the Primer Design System.

## Overview

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::SubHeaderPreview, :default %>

## Anatomy

### Desktop

The sub header accepts a number of additional components.

On the left side:

- **Search filter**: (Optional) A basic [text input](https://primer.style/components/text-input) with a [search icon](https://primer.style/components/text-input#with-leading-and-trailing-visuals) which is mostly used on index pages to filter the elements below.
- **Filter button:**Â (Optional) A button which is shown next to the filter input (or on the very left, if there is no filter input)
- **Segmented controls** (optional) to switch two pre-filtered views
- **Action buttons**: (Optional) A set of buttons 

At the center of the sub header:

- **Text:** (Optional) A bold text shown in the middle of the SubHeader

On the right side: 

- **A primary button**: (Optional) This is often an *add* action
- **Secondary buttons**: (Optional) Rarer but additional actions can be offered to the user.

### Mobile

The Sub header automatically adapts to mobile screens:

- The actions on the left side always turn into icon buttons without labels. * Note: All sub header items must have an icon specified, even if the desktop version does not show it.*
- The search button is also just an icon; on click, it takes the full length (hiding all other actions), with a cancel button to go back to the previous state
- The right-side actions (usually a solitary primary add "+ {Object} button) will remain in its full form. They will not go into icon-only mode.
- All actions that do not have a visible label need a title or ARIA label for accessibility


## Best practices

**Do**

- Restrict SubHeader actions to the page's content-specific actions (e.g. filtering or creating a new object).
- Use IconButtons instead of Buttons for actions only when the icon is clear enough to describe the action.
- When more actions are necessary, or if a menu is needed, use an ActionMenu instead of the ActionButtons.
- Specify an icon for all items, even if it is not displayed int he desktop version

**Don't**

- Use the SubHeader to perform generic view actions (should be part of the PageHeader)

## Used in

* Project list
* Members
* Meetings
* Storages
* ...
