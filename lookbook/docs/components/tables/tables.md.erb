## Overview

We currently have two components for implementing a table view:

* a (sortable) `TableComponent`
* a (unsortable, primer based) `BorderBoxTableComponent`

**Sortable table**

<%= embed OpenProject::Deprecated::TablePreview, :default %>

**Border Box Table**

<%= embed OpPrimer::BorderBoxTableComponentPreview, :default %>

For the specifics of that component please have a look at the [BorderBoxTableComponent docs](./border_box_table).

## Anatomy

**Sortable table**

* The Sortable Table results in a standard HTML table with some classes applied for styling.
* If `sortable` is set to true, all sortable column headers are clickable to change the sort order. When a sort is applied, that is indicated via an arrow.

**Border Box Table**

* The BorderBoxTable is based on the `Primer::Beta::BorderBox` with a CSS grid applied inside to align the individual rows and make it look like a table.

## Technical notes

The `BorderBoxTableComponent` is a subclass of the `TableComponent`, so the following notes apply to both components. There are however some additional things to consider, for that please visit the [BorderBoxTableComponent docs](./border_box_table).

To use either table implementation, you need to subclass the following classes onto your own namespace:

- **Regular table:** `TableComponent` and `RowComponent`
- **BorderBox table:** `OpPrimer::BorderBoxTableComponent` and `OpPrimer::BorderBoxRowComponent`

**Columns**

Define the columns of the table as class method:

```ruby
module ModuleA
  class TableComponent < ::TableComponent
    columns :name, :description, :sort
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Headers**

Define the headers of the component as a method:

```ruby
module ModuleA
  class TableComponent < ::TableComponent
    # ...

    def headers
      [
        [:a, { caption: 'Column A' }],
        [:b, { caption: 'Column B' }],
        [:c, { caption: 'Column C' }]
      ]
    end

  # ...
  end
end
```

**Actions**

Define the actions in the row component as `button_links`. See the example code:
