The <strong>CollapsibleSection</strong> is awesome :)

<%= embed Patterns::CollapsibleSectionPreview, :default %>

## Anatomy

The CollapsibleSection consists of two basic parts: the title and the content that shall be collapsed. However, for the title there are some additional options available:

- The title
  - A caption (optional): Text, shown next to the title in a subtle colour
  - Additional information (optional): Free content, shown at the end of the title row
- The collapsible content area

## Best practices

**Do**

**Don't**

- Don't use the CollapsibleSection if you want to collapse the content of a BorderBox. Use the [BorderBox::CollapsibleHeader](./tables/border-box-table.md.erb) instead.
- Don't use too complex elements for the `additional_information` slot. It is designed for small texts or an individual button.
