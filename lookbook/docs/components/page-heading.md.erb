The OP Heading component is a custom component which should be used for individual headers on a page below the `Primer::OpenProject::PageHeader`. It allows you to use a standard HTML heading with appropriate styling for use within OpenProject.

## Note

The OP Heading is not meant as a complete replacement of the Primer Heading as that one might can still be used, for example in the `Primer::OpenProject::SidePanel`.

## Overview

<%= embed Patterns::HeadingPreview, :default %>

## Anatomy

The OP Heading consists simply of a regular HTML `h` tag. It takes one input to specify which level of heading (from h1 to h6) should be used.

## Options

Currently, there are no additional options implemented. It is planned to support an optional divider at the bottom.

This is useful in places like Settings pages that might need more visual differentiation between sections.

## Used in

The `Heading` is used:

- Recurring meetings and meeting series index pages

## Technical notes

Internally, the `Primer::OpenProject::Heading` component calls the normal `Primer::Beta::Heading` with an overwritten (lower) font-weight.
