The Border Box element is used to display structured items in a list, each with a set of actions. It is used for example:


## Anatomy

The Border Box element is made up of

1. The **header**, which acts as a container for the items below and helps distinguish between sections. It is optional.
2. Individual **items** below can vary in what information they show.

If a page uses a Border Box with a header, all sections must use headers.

## Header

Note for Parimal:
You can chose between a collapsibleHeader and a free-chosen Header. The collapsible Header consists of Title, counter(optional) and description(optional).

The header can either be static or collapsible. 

The collapsibleHeader brings additional functionality:

- an **arrow indicator** next to the title  indicates if the section is collapsed or expanded. 
- a **header description** (optional) to give additional context to the content of that section. Hidden when collapsed.
- a **counter** (optional) displays the number of items that that particular section contains.
  
When collapsed, the bottom border is slightly thicker to indicate something is hidden.

Both the collapsible header and static heads can accept additional actions. For example, a **more button** can offer additional contextual actions such as edit, delete and move (move up, move to top, move down, move to the end).

## Uses

- to display a list of meetings
- to display individual meeting agenda items in a meeting
- to display the a list of project attributes
- to display a list of configured OAuth applications

If the content needs to be more structured (with columns and column headers), please use the [Border Box Table](border-box-table) component instead.

## Best practices

**Do**

- Use sections (with headers) to better organise content if they have logical categories (eg. Open and Planned meetings).
- Do make the header and items draggable if the user should be able to drag individual items  up and down and into other sections. The sections themselves can also be dragged up and down to change order.

**Don't**

- Don't mix sections with and without headers. If one section has a header, they must all have headers.
- Don't make sections collapsible if they do not need to be.
