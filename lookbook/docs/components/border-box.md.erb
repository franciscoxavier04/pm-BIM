The Border Box element is used to display structured items in a list, each with a set of actions. It is used for example:

- to display a list of meetings
- to display individual meeting agenda items in a meeting
- to display the a list of project attributes
- to display a list of configured OAuth applications

## Anatomy

The Border Box element is made up of

1. The **header** acts as a container for the items below it. It's often to distinguish between sections. It is optional.
2. Individual **items** below can vary in what information they show.

If a page uses a Border Box with a header, all sections must use headers.

## Header

Note for Parimal:
You can chose between a collapsibleHeader and a free-chosen Header. The collapsible Header consists of Title, counter(optional) and description(optional).

- **Collapsible header**: A collapsible header has an arrow next to the title and allows collapsing and expanding the contents below. When collapsed, the bottom border is slightly thicker to indicate something is hidden.
  - **Header description**: When collapsed, the optional header description is hidden.
  - **Header counter**: The counter can display the number of items that that particular section contains.

- **More button**: A more button can have contextual actions such as edit, delete and move (move up, move to top, move down, move to the end).

## Best practices

**Do**

- Use sections (with headers) to better organise content if they have logical categories (eg. Open and Planned meetings).
- - **Draggable**: Both header and items can have drag handles. Individual items can be dragged up and down and into other sections. The sections themselves can also be moved up and down.

**Don't**

- Don't mix sections with and without headers. If one section has a header, they must all have headers.
- Don't make sections collapsible if they do not need to be.
